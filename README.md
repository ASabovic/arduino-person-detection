# arduino-person-detection
This repository contains code that enables the person detection on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board. Also, there are scripts that enable the BLE connection between the Arduino board and the IoT gateway (using Bleak library) as well as MQTT connection and data transfer between the same gateway and the Cloud, where the heavy-weight ML model is running.
